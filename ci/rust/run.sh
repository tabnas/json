# That version check is the common case stated clearly; it is NOT the whole

# the crate's own version alone, so it sails past the comparison above while
# leaving the committed lock stale -- cargo then regenerates it in the
# runner and everything goes green. Verified: adding a dependency without
# regenerating took the lock from 20 packages to 21 mid-run, exit 0.
#
# So the whole resolution is compared, before and after cargo runs, with one
# exemption: the engine's recorded version. That entry legitimately moves
# whenever the sibling checkout does, and exempting exactly it is what makes
# a full comparison usable here when blanket `--locked` is not.

# NOT `--locked`, deliberately, and this is the one place the plugin gate
# differs from the engine's own (parser ci/rust/run.sh does pass it).
#
# Cargo.lock records the engine by version, and the engine is resolved
# from a sibling checkout of MAIN. So the day parser bumps its crate
# version, `--locked` here fails with "cannot update the lock file" on
# every pull request in this repo, including ones that touch no Rust at
# all -- a red build caused by another repository's release. Reproduced
# by bumping the sibling's version and re-running: `--locked` fails, the
# plain build succeeds. The engine repo has no path dependency of its
# own, which is why `--locked` is right there and wrong here.
# NOT `--all`. cargo defines it as "all packages, and also their local
# path-based dependencies", and the engine IS such a dependency, so
# `--all` reaches into the sibling parser checkout: an unformatted file
# over there fails this gate even when every file here is clean, and a
# contributor with dirty sibling work cannot run it at all. Verified both
# ways -- with the sibling made unformatted, `--all --check` reports a
# diff in parser/rs and plain `--check` stays silent, while a dirty file
# in THIS crate still fails plain `--check`. The engine repo has no path
# dependency, which is why `--all` is safe there and not here.
